"""
Memory CRUD and query operations for remembering skill.

This module handles:
- Memory creation (remember, remember_bg)
- Memory querying (recall, recall_since, recall_between)
- Memory updates (supersede, reprioritize)
- Memory deletion (forget)
- Access tracking

Imports from: state, turso, config

v5.4.0: Enhanced retrieval with tag co-occurrence expansion and boost-aware scoring (#383).
v5.0.0: Removed local cache dependency. All queries go through Turso FTS5.

        episodic: If True, include access-pattern boosting in ranking (#296).
            Frequently accessed memories get a logarithmic boost, rewarding
            validated-useful memories over unaccessed ones.
        exploration: If True, apply exploration boost favoring rarely-accessed
            memories (#paper-MIA). Adds 1/(1+access_count) bonus to ranking,
            preventing heavily-accessed memories from monopolizing results.
            Mutually exclusive with episodic (exploration wins if both set).
        use_cache: Deprecated (v5.0.0). Ignored - all queries go to Turso.

    Returns:
        MemoryResultList of MemoryResult objects (or list of dicts if raw=True).

    """Store a structured decision trace with standardized format.

    Creates a decision memory with a structured body that captures not just
    what was decided but why, what was rejected, and what to watch out for.
    Decision traces are automatically tagged with "decision-trace" for retrieval.

    Args:
        choice: What was decided (the outcome).
        context: What problem was being solved (the trigger).
        rationale: Why this choice was made (the reasoning).
        alternatives: Optional list of rejected alternatives.
            Each item: dict with 'option' and 'rejected' keys.
            Example: [{"option": "Redis", "rejected": "Over-engineered for our scale"}]
        tradeoffs: Optional description of known tradeoffs accepted.
        contraindications: Optional conditions where this decision should be revisited.
        tags: Additional tags (auto-includes "decision-trace").
        refs: Optional list of referenced memory IDs.
        conf: Confidence in the decision (default 0.9).
        priority: Priority level (default 1 = important).

    Returns:
        Memory ID (UUID).

    Example:
        >>> decision_trace(
        ...     choice="Chose Turso FTS5 over local SQLite cache",
        ...     context="Need to simplify architecture after cache sync bugs",
        ...     rationale="Cache latency savings (~145ms) negligible vs tool overhead (~3-4s). "
        ...               "Eliminating sync eliminates a whole class of bugs.",
        ...     alternatives=[
        ...         {"option": "Keep local cache", "rejected": "Ongoing sync bugs"},
        ...         {"option": "Redis", "rejected": "External dependency, overkill"}
        ...     ],
        ...     tradeoffs="Slightly higher latency per query, network dependency",
        ...     contraindications="If tool call overhead drops below 500ms, reconsider caching",
        ...     tags=["architecture", "turso"]
