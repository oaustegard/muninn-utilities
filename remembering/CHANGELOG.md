# Muninn Memory System - Changelog

All notable changes to the `remembering` skill (Muninn) are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [5.8.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- make background-write failures visible (#622) (#622)

### Fixed

- loosen retry budget for egress-proxy cold start (#621)
- security hardening from adversarial review (#541)
- config_set preserves boot_load on update (#591)

### Other

- remembering: pull canonical muninn_utils from public muninn-utilities repo (#625)
- boot: persist Turso creds to ~/.muninn/.env after successful init (#599)

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `fetch_muninn_utils()` in `scripts/utilities.py`. Pulls canonical
  `muninn_utils/*.py` from `oaustegard/muninn-utilities` (public) via a
  single tarball fetch and writes them into `UTIL_DIR`, overriding any
  Turso `utility-code` materialization for utilities already migrated.
  `boot()` calls it after `install_utilities()` — non-migrated utilities
  continue to work via the Turso fallback. No auth required (public repo),
  no-ops cleanly on network failure. Continues the migration tracked in
  memory `0d63ed4f`.

### Fixed

- `config_set` now preserves `boot_load` on update. Previously, every update silently re-promoted reference-only entries to boot-loaded because `INSERT OR REPLACE` omitted the `boot_load` column. This was particularly painful for auto-maintained keys like `recall-triggers` (rewritten on every `remember()` call).

## [5.7.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- confidence-weighted scoring + exploration mode (#542)
- add telemetry flag to boot() for performance instrumentation (#533)
- add task parameter for perch task prompts (#528) (#529)
- add mapping-features skill for behavioral web app documentation (#432)
- surface due reminders in boot() output (#425)
- enhanced recall() with tag co-occurrence expansion and boost-aware scoring (#383)
- replace esm.sh CDN with vendored deps + container testing
- add time anchor to boot output for temporal grounding
- slim boot mode for perch + timeout bump (#353)

### Changed

- is_superseded column — kill the hot-path json_each subquery (#570)
- batch access_count updates to cut Turso write volume (#569)

### Fixed

- boot _time_anchor robust to multi-line tz config + write /tmp/LOCAL_DATE (#584)
- refs in remember() is citation-only, not supersede (#583)
- retry on egress-proxy 503 ('DNS cache overflow') in remembering + invoking-gemini (#580)
- guard NULL in refs array (closes #543) (#552)
- use ~/muninn_utils instead of hardcoded /home/claude

### Other

- Remove _MAP.md files, direct agents to tree-sitting for code navigation (#545)
- Add spoke discovery module to remembering skill
- boot: progressive disclosure overhaul — 102K→16K chars
- marketplace: restructure as category-based plugins for Claude Code discovery (#530)
- Fix inter-zone tearing by unifying epsilon across zones (#512) (#513)
- Regenerate _MAP.md files after @lat: backlink insertion (#504)
- Lattice v2: bidirectional source-anchored knowledge graph (#503)
- Normalize timezone-aware inputs to UTC for DB queries (#461)
- Convert recall() valid_from timestamps from UTC to America/New_York
- Boot: replace _load_due_reminders() with remind_due() from utility (#445)
- Implement #414, #415, #416: perch findings digests, boot flight awareness, inline links
- Update CHANGELOG.md — v5.5.0: TF-IDF similarity, flowing DAG, batched therapy

## [5.7.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **`_time_anchor()` falls back to UTC silently when `timezone` profile value contains trailing instructional text** (#boot-tz-multiline): The `timezone` profile config sometimes carries date-grounding instructions appended after the IANA name (e.g. `"America/New_York\n\nDATE GROUNDING (added 2026-04-13)..."`). `ZoneInfo()` rejects the multi-line string and the existing exception handler silently falls back to UTC — so the boot header reads `UTC | DST: inactive` even when the user is in EDT, which is exactly the failure mode the time anchor was added to prevent. Boot now extracts the first non-empty line of the timezone value before passing it to `ZoneInfo`, so multi-line profile entries work as long as the IANA name comes first.

### Added

- **`/tmp/LOCAL_DATE` written at boot**: `_time_anchor()` now writes today's local date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) to `/tmp/LOCAL_DATE` as a side effect, matching the contract that several ops entries and skills already document (e.g. "cat /tmp/LOCAL_DATE for date grounding"). Best-effort — write failure does not break boot.

## [5.7.0] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **`refs` no longer auto-supersedes referenced memories** (#issue-refs-no-auto-supersede): `_write_memory` previously ran `UPDATE memories SET is_superseded = 1 WHERE id IN (refs...)` after every insert, conflating two distinct semantics:
  - **Supersede edges** — "this memory replaces the referenced ones" (handled by `supersede()`)
  - **Citation/provenance edges** — "this memory was derived from / cites the referenced ones" (used by Phase 3 syntheses, `boot.py` reflection clusters, manual provenance refs)

  The auto-flag silently corrupted the second pattern. On 2026-04-26 it took out an entire batch of 6 living-reference syntheses (the L5a retrieval layer) plus 5 prototype-log analyses and 34 cited source memories — all flagged `is_superseded=1` within seconds of creation, by the prototype-log writes that immediately followed each synthesis. Total contaminated flags: ~45.

  **Behavior change:** `remember(refs=[...])` is now a pure citation expression. The referenced rows are unaffected. Use `supersede(original_id, ...)` when you actually mean replacement — that path remains the single source of truth for the `is_superseded` flag.

### Notes for callers

- `consolidate()` previously relied on the auto-flag side effect to hide cluster source memories from default recall. Its explicit code only demotes sources to `priority=-1` (background). After this fix, source memories remain technically active (not superseded) but stay deprioritized via `priority=-1`. Recall callers that already filter by priority are unaffected; callers that relied on the supersede flag to hide consolidated sources will now see them in low-priority results. If hard supersede semantics are wanted in `consolidate()`, prefer making it explicit there.
- `boot.py` reflection clustering uses `refs` as citations and was previously corrupting its own source memories. This fix is the intended behavior.

## [5.5.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **TF-IDF Memory Similarity Index** (#404): New `memory_tfidf` utility module using sklearn's `TfidfVectorizer` for memory↔memory cosine similarity. Builds index over full corpus (~1096 memories) in ~1.5s, pairwise cosine in 18ms. Provides:
  - `MemoryIndex.similar(id)` — find memories most similar to a given one
  - `MemoryIndex.duplicates(threshold)` — pairs above similarity threshold
  - `MemoryIndex.clusters(threshold)` — single-linkage similarity clusters
  - `MemoryIndex.outliers()` — memories dissimilar to everything (isolation candidates)
  - `MemoryIndex.cross_domain_rhymes(id)` — high similarity + low tag overlap for structural pattern matching
- **Flowing DAG Runner as utility** (#404): `flowing` module (from `searching-codebases` skill) stored as utility-code memory. Enables batching multiple independent operations into a single tool call via `@task` decorator and `Flow` runner with ThreadPoolExecutor parallelism.
- **Batched Therapy Phase 1** (#404): New `phase1()` function in therapy utility runs all four Phase 1 queries (`pending_tests`, `neglected_memories`, `test_debris`, `duplicate_candidates`) in parallel via flowing DAG. Reduces 4-5 tool calls to 1. Measured: 1596ms total.
- **`searching-codebases` skill**: TF-IDF semantic code search with full pipeline (download → map → index → search → extract). Uses flowing for DAG orchestration. Pushed to repo (ad069a04).

### Changed

- **`duplicate_candidates()` upgraded**: Replaced 80-character summary prefix matching with TF-IDF cosine similarity. Catches rephrasings, reorderings, and near-duplicates that prefix matching missed. Operates on full corpus instead of last 100 memories.

### Fixed

- **Corrected stale architecture belief**: Retrieval is BM25 (FTS5) only — no semantic embeddings. OpenAI embedding endpoint was abandoned months ago due to flakiness. Stored priority-2 correction memory.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- restructure boot output for progressive disclosure

### Other

- Add Python script standards and commit hygiene to AGENTS.md

## [5.3.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- structural task discipline for Muninn — checklists, recall gate, cross-session persistence

## [5.2.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- show USE WHEN directives for utilities in boot CAPABILITIES

## [5.1.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- add analysis memory type instead of overloading world (#328)
- skip gh install when already available (#245)

## [5.1.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `analysis` memory type for findings from structured analysis or research (#328)

## [5.1.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- v5.1.0 — partial IDs, curation, episodic scoring, decision traces, FTS5 improvements

### Fixed

- resolve issues #311 and #312 in claude_client.py

### Other

- rename uploads/ to .uploads/ and update all references

## [5.1.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Partial ID support** (#244): `forget()`, `supersede()`, `reprioritize()`, `strengthen()`, `weaken()` now accept abbreviated memory IDs. Resolves unique prefix to full UUID; raises `ValueError` on ambiguous or unmatched prefixes. New `_resolve_memory_id()` helper.
- **Autonomous memory curation** (#295): New `curate()` function detects consolidation opportunities, stale memories, and recommends cleanup actions. Supports `dry_run=True` (analysis only) and `dry_run=False` (auto-apply consolidation and demotion).
- **Episodic relevance scoring** (#296): New `episodic=True` parameter on `recall()` adds access-pattern boosting to composite score: `ln(1 + access_count) × 0.2`. Rewards memories validated through repeated retrieval.
- **Decision trace storage** (#297): New `decision_trace()` convenience function creates structured decision memories with standardized fields (choice, context, rationale, alternatives, tradeoffs, contraindications). Auto-tagged `"decision-trace"`.
- **FTS5 tag weight increase** (#309): Tag column BM25 weight raised from 0.5 to 1.0, so tagged memories rank higher when queries match tag terms.
- **Improved summary_preview** (#309): Large multi-topic memories (>150 chars) now have tag-prefixed previews (e.g., `[mcp, architecture] Content...`), preventing misleading truncation.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- migrate recall() to Turso FTS5 and remove local cache (#300, #301)

## [4.5.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- add server-side FTS5 search and batch APIs (#298, #299)

## [4.5.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- Server-side FTS5 search via `_fts5_search()` in turso.py (#298) — queries memory_fts virtual table with BM25 × recency × priority composite scoring
- `recall_batch()` for executing multiple search queries in a single HTTP round-trip (#299) — uses server-side FTS5, falls back to sequential recall()
- `remember_batch()` for storing multiple memories in a single HTTP round-trip (#299) — per-item validation with isolated error handling

## [4.4.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- remove root __init__.py for clean skill upload

## [4.4.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- Add .skillignore support for release packaging

### Other

- Update version number to 4.3.1 in SKILL.md

## [4.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- implement issues #229, #231, #281, #282, #283 (v4.3.0)

### Fixed

- parse multi-line signatures in --use-maps mode

## [4.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **Time-windowed recall** (#281): Added `since` and `until` parameters to `recall()` for filtering memories by creation time. Accepts ISO date strings with inclusive bounds. Works alongside all other parameters (search, tags, type, etc.).
- **Multi-tag convenience parameters** (#282): Added `tags_all` and `tags_any` parameters to `recall()` as syntactic sugar for `tags=[...], tag_mode="all"/"any"`. Cannot combine both in one call.
- **Reference chain traversal** (#283): Elevated `get_chain(memory_id, depth=3)` to core API. Follows refs to build context graphs around a memory with cycle detection. Max depth capped at 10.
- **Session continuity** (#231): Added `session_save()`, `session_resume()`, and `sessions()` for checkpoint-based session persistence. Sessions can be saved with optional context data and resumed later.
- **Architecture reference** (#229): Created `_ARCH.md` with schema overview, module map, data flow diagrams, and design decisions.

### Note

- **FTS5 optimization** (#230): Already implemented in v4.0.0 (Porter stemmer, BM25 ranking, `memory_fts` virtual table). No additional work needed.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-02-13

### Other

- Update SKILL.md

## [4.2.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Address top 3 priority GitHub issues (#253, #254, #276)

## [4.1.0] - 2026-02-11

### Other

- Add fetch_all parameter to recall() for comprehensive memory retrieval

## [4.1.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **`fetch_all` parameter for comprehensive memory retrieval** (#257): Added explicit `fetch_all=True` parameter to `recall()` for retrieving all memories without search filtering. This replaces the non-functional wildcard pattern approach (e.g., `recall("*")`).
- **Wildcard pattern validation** (#257): `recall()` now detects and rejects wildcard patterns (`*`, `%`, `?`) with helpful error messages guiding users to use `fetch_all=True` instead.

### Fixed

- **Wildcard pattern interpretation** (#257): Previously `recall("*", n=...)` was interpreted as a literal text search for asterisks, returning incorrect results. Now users get clear guidance to use `recall(fetch_all=True, n=...)` for comprehensive retrieval.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- export _exec in public API and document muninn_utils

### Other

- Update version from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 in SKILL.md

## [4.0.0] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- restructure to follow AgentSkills standards (v4.0.0)

## [3.8.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- fix top 5 open issues (v3.8.0)

## [3.7.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- fix three issues - aliases, expansion threshold, return format (v3.7.0)

## [3.6.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- Add priority-based ordering and dynamic ops topics (v3.6.0)

## [3.6.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Priority-based ordering within ops categories** (#250): Ops entries within each topic are now sorted by priority (descending). Higher priority entries appear first.
- **Dynamic OPS_TOPICS loading from config** (#251): Topic categories can now be loaded from `config_get('ops-topics')` instead of being hardcoded. Falls back to built-in defaults if config is missing.
- **New `config_set_priority()` function**: Set priority for config entries to control ordering within categories.
- **New `priority` column in config table**: Stores priority level (default 0, higher = more important).

### Changed

- `boot()` now refreshes OPS_TOPICS from config on each call
- `group_ops_by_topic()` sorts entries by priority (descending), then alphabetically by key
- Uncategorized ops ("Other" section) are also sorted by priority

## [3.5.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- Add GitHub access detection and CAPABILITIES section to boot
- Add skill for cross-skill Python imports (#217)

## [3.4.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- Add type-safe MemoryResult and proactive recall_hints (#211, #212)
- Add optional authentication for personalized feeds

### Other

- Update claude-ai-project-instructions.md

## [3.4.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **Type-safe MemoryResult objects** (#212): `recall()`, `recall_since()`, and `recall_between()` now return `MemoryResult` objects that validate field access immediately. Invalid field names like `m['content']` raise helpful errors with suggestions like "Did you mean 'summary'?".
- **Proactive memory hints** (#211): New `recall_hints()` function scans context or terms against memory tags and summaries, surfacing relevant memories before mistakes happen.
- **New exports**: `MemoryResult`, `MemoryResultList`, `VALID_FIELDS`, `recall_hints`
- **Backward compatibility**: Use `raw=True` parameter on recall functions to get plain dicts, or call `m.to_dict()` on results.

### Changed

- `recall()`, `recall_since()`, `recall_between()` return `MemoryResultList` of `MemoryResult` objects by default
- All dict-style operations still work (`m['field']`, `'field' in m`, iteration, etc.)

## [3.3.3] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

- remove stale _load_env_file import from remembering/__init__.py

## [3.3.2] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- rename getting-env to configuring for Python import compatibility

### Changed

- simplify turso.py by delegating env loading to configuring skill
- use configuring skill for TURSO_URL with protocol-agnostic config

## [3.3.2] - 2026-01-22

### Changed

- **Simplified credential loading**: Removed redundant `muninn.env` fallback logic in `turso.py` since the `configuring` skill already loads all `.env` files in `/mnt/project`
- **Protocol-agnostic TURSO_URL**: Support storing database URL without `https://` protocol (automatically added if missing)
- **Cleaner dependencies**: Removed `_load_env_file()` function as `configuring` skill handles all environment file parsing
- **Improved error messages**: Updated credential error messages to clarify that `configuring` skill auto-detects `.env` files

### Technical

- Priority order simplified: configuring skill → env vars → legacy files (removed redundant muninn.env check)
- Configuration now fully delegated to `configuring` skill for consistency across all Claude environments

## [3.3.1] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- extend env loading for codex and turso

## [3.3.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- Implement memory consolidation and API efficiency improvements (v3.3.0)

### Fixed

- Align bootstrap.py schema with v2.0.0+ and current code

## [3.2.1] - 2026-01-21

- Release 3.2.1

## [3.2.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- v3.2.0 - session scoping, security hardening, and observability

## [3.2.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- **Session Scoping**: Added `session_id` parameter to `remember()`, `recall()`, `recall_since()`, and `recall_between()` for filtering memories by conversation or work session
- **Session Management**: New `get_session_id()` and `set_session_id()` functions for managing session context
- **Security Hardening**: Converted all SQL queries to parameterized statements, eliminating SQL injection vulnerabilities in `_query()`, `recall_since()`, and `recall_between()`
- **Automatic Flush**: Added atexit hook that automatically flushes pending background writes on process exit to prevent data loss
- **Retrieval Observability**: New `recall_stats()` function for monitoring query performance (cache hit rate, avg exec time, etc.)
- **Query Analytics**: New `top_queries()` function for identifying most common search patterns
- **Memory Distribution**: New `memory_histogram()` function for analyzing memory distribution by type, priority, and age
- **Retention Management**: New `prune_by_age()` and `prune_by_priority()` functions for managing memory lifecycle

### Changed

- Session ID column re-enabled in memories table (was removed in v2.0.0, now restored with index for performance)
- `_write_memory()` now accepts and persists session_id parameter
- Environment variable `MUNINN_SESSION_ID` can be used to set default session ID

### Fixed

- SQL injection vulnerabilities in query construction (all queries now use parameterized statements)
- Data loss risk from background writes not flushing on abnormal process termination

### Security

- **CRITICAL**: All SQL queries now use parameterized statements instead of string interpolation
- Eliminated SQL injection attack surface in search, tag filtering, and session filtering

## [3.1.0] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- Use strict mode for deterministic handoff and decision queries

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- Bump to v3.0.0 for utility auto-installation
- Integrate utility installation into boot.py
- Add 'interaction' memory type to remembering skill
- add line numbers, markdown ToC, and other files listing

### Fixed

- improve boot.py cache fallback, extract OPS_TOPICS, use markdown headings
- limit markdown ToC to h1/h2 headings only

### Other

- Revise version info and remove migration instructions

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- **BREAKING**: Integrated utility code installation into `boot()` - utilities now auto-install during boot sequence
- Created `remembering/utilities.py` module with `install_utilities()` function
- Added UTILITIES section to boot output showing installed utility count and names
- Exported `install_utilities` and `UTIL_DIR` in `__init__.py`

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `boot()` now automatically materializes utility-code memories to disk at `/home/claude/muninn_utils/`
- Updated `utility-code-storage` ops entry to reflect automatic installation (removed manual bootstrap instructions)

### Removed

- Manual utility bootstrap code no longer needed in project instructions (now handled by skill)

### Significance

This is a major version bump because the skill can now manage its own utility code - a significant architectural capability. The skill is no longer just about memory storage; it can self-update operational code through the utility system.

## [0.12.2] - 2025-12-30

- Release 0.12.2

## [0.12.1] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed

- **Strict Query Mode for therapy_scope() Bug Fix**
  - Fixed bug where `therapy_scope()` returned MOST RELEVANT therapy session instead of LATEST
  - Added `strict=True` parameter to `recall()` for timestamp-only ordering
  - Strict mode skips FTS5/BM25 ranking and uses plain SQL with `ORDER BY t DESC`
  - Updated `therapy_scope()` to use `strict=True` - now correctly returns newest session

### Technical Details

**Bug Background**:
- `recall()` always ordered by composite_rank (BM25 + salience + recency + access)
- When `therapy_scope()` asked for n=1, it got best-ranked match, not newest
- Example: Session #2 (2025-12-26) had composite_rank=-15.6, Session #4 (2025-12-28, newer) had composite_rank=-14.1
- Result: Muninn kept thinking sessions were older than they actually were

**Use Cases for Strict Mode**:
- `therapy_scope()`: Get newest therapy session by timestamp
- "All decisions from last week": Date filter + type, no ranking needed
- "Latest handoff": Tag match with timestamp order
- Any query where relevance ranking adds noise to chronological ordering

**API Changes**:
```python
# Strict mode: timestamp ordering, no ranking
sessions = recall(type="experience", tags=["therapy"], n=1, strict=True)

# Regular mode: composite ranking (BM25 + salience + recency + access)
sessions = recall(type="experience", tags=["therapy"], n=1)
```

## [0.12.0] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- **Query Logging for Retrieval Instrumentation (Phase 0)**
  - New `recall_logs` table in local cache tracks all recall() queries
  - Automatically logs: query text, filters, result counts, execution time, cache/semantic usage
  - Foundation for future relevance scoring and filtering (Phases 1-4)
  - Enables retrieval quality analysis and optimization

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE recall_logs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    t TEXT NOT NULL,
    query TEXT,
    filters TEXT,              -- JSON: {type, tags, conf, tag_mode}
    n_requested INTEGER,
    n_returned INTEGER,
    exec_time_ms REAL,
    used_cache BOOLEAN,
    used_semantic_fallback BOOLEAN
);
```

**Usage**:
```python
# Query logs are written automatically by recall()
# View logs directly from cache DB at ~/.muninn/cache.db

import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path

conn = sqlite3.connect(str(Path.home() / ".muninn" / "cache.db"))
logs = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM recall_logs ORDER BY t DESC LIMIT 10").fetchall()
```

**Next Steps**: Phases 1-4 will add relevance scoring, filtering, outcome tracking, and calibration based on these logs.

## [0.11.0] - 2025-12-30

### Changed

- **Compressed Boot Output**
  - Modified `boot()` function to return formatted string instead of raw tuples
  - Output format: key + first line for config entries
  - Token reduction: ~4.3K chars (~1073 tokens) vs previous multi-line format
  - Simplified usage: `print(boot())` replaces 15-line boot_fast() + formatting block
  - Still populates local cache for fast subsequent recall() queries

**API Change**:
```python
# Old (v0.10.x and earlier)
profile, ops, journal, decisions = boot()
for p in profile:
    print(p['value'])

# New (v0.11.0+)
output = boot()
print(output)  # Shows compressed key + first line format

# Access full content when needed
from remembering import config_get
full_text = config_get("identity")
```

**Performance**:
- Execution: ~150ms (single HTTP request)
- Output: ~4.3K chars (~1073 tokens)
- Subsequent recall(): ~2ms via local cache

## [0.10.1] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Embedding Reliability Monitoring & Batch Retry**
  - New `embedding_stats()` function for tracking embedding coverage and failure rates
    - Returns total/with/without embeddings counts
    - Calculates failure rate percentage
    - Provides 7-day timeline of embedding failures
    - Lists recent memories without embeddings
  - New `retry_embeddings(limit, dry_run, batch_size)` function for batch-retrying failed embeddings
    - Uses OpenAI's batch embedding API (up to 2048 texts per request)
    - Processes memories that are missing embeddings (NULL in embedding column)
    - Useful after API outages (503 errors) or when API key was initially missing
    - Supports dry_run mode to preview what would be retried
    - Updates both Turso database and local cache

**Investigation Results**:
- Overall embedding failure rate: 20.9% (38 of 182 memories)
- Root causes identified:
  - Dec 22-24: 100% failure (23 memories) - EMBEDDING_API_KEY not configured
  - Dec 26-28: 7-19% failure - mix of API outages and intermittent 503 errors
- Recent days (Dec 27-28): 7-9% failure rate, still above 5% threshold
- Retry logic working correctly (exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s)
- System gracefully degrades: FTS5 search continues working when embeddings fail

**API Changes**:
```python
# Monitor embedding health
stats = embedding_stats()
print(f"Failure rate: {stats['failure_rate']:.1f}%")

# Batch retry missing embeddings
result = retry_embeddings(limit=50)
print(f"Successfully embedded {result['successful']} memories")
```

**Recommendation**: Run `retry_embeddings()` after extended API outages or when EMBEDDING_API_KEY is first configured. Monitor `embedding_stats()` during therapy sessions to track embedding health over time.

## [0.10.0] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed

- Fixed cache auto-init bug: cache now auto-initializes on module import if DB exists
  - Fixes: remember() and recall() now work across bash_tool calls (different Python processes)
  - Impact: Eliminates "memory stored but not found" issues in multi-step workflows
- Fixed ambiguous column names in semantic_recall() vector search
  - All column references now qualified with table names (memories.*, m2.*)
  - Prevents SQL errors when JOIN queries include columns with same names
- Fixed VERSION file exclusion in release workflow
  - VERSION file now included in skill ZIP for runtime version detection
  - Enables version-aware features and handoff_complete() auto-versioning

### Added

- **Salience Decay & Composite Ranking (Biological Memory Model)**
  - New `salience` column for therapy-adjustable memory ranking multiplier (default 1.0)
  - Composite ranking formula: `BM25 * salience * recency_weight * access_weight`
    - `recency_weight`: 1 / (1 + days_since_access / 30) - exponential decay over 30-day half-life
    - `access_weight`: ln(1 + access_count) - logarithmic boost for frequently accessed memories
    - `salience`: therapy-adjustable multiplier for manual consolidation
  - Access tracking automatically updates both Turso and cache for ranking consistency
  - New API functions for memory consolidation:
    - `strengthen(memory_id, factor=1.5)`: Boost salience for confirmed patterns
    - `weaken(memory_id, factor=0.5)`: Reduce salience for noise/obsolete memories

**Performance Impact:**
- recall() with search: <5ms (composite ranking adds negligible overhead)
- recall() without search: <5ms (composite score replaces simple time sort)
- strengthen()/weaken(): ~150ms (updates both Turso and cache)

**Migration**: Run `python bootstrap.py` to add salience column. Existing memories default to salience=1.0.

**Example - Therapy Session:**
```python
from remembering import therapy_scope, strengthen, weaken, remember

# Get unprocessed memories
cutoff, mems = therapy_scope()

# Identify patterns
for m in mems:
    if 'performance' in m.get('tags', []):
        strengthen(m['id'], factor=2.0)  # Reinforce performance insights
    elif m.get('confidence', 1.0) < 0.3:
        weaken(m['id'], factor=0.3)  # Downrank low-confidence memories

# Record therapy session
remember("Therapy: Strengthened performance patterns, weakened speculation",
         "experience", tags=["therapy"])
```

## [0.9.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed

- Fixed tag filtering with `tag_mode="all"` - now correctly requires ALL tags to match
- Fixed FTS5 duplicate entries by using DELETE + INSERT pattern instead of INSERT OR REPLACE
- Added `tag_mode` parameter to `_cache_query_index()` for proper tag intersection

**Bug 1 - Tag Filtering**: The `_cache_query_index()` function didn't accept or respect the `tag_mode` parameter, always using OR logic for tags. Now correctly supports both `tag_mode="any"` (OR) and `tag_mode="all"` (AND).

**Bug 2 - FTS5 Duplicates**: FTS5 virtual tables don't support `INSERT OR REPLACE`, causing duplicate entries (212 FTS5 entries vs 107 memories = 1.98x ratio). Fixed by using `DELETE + INSERT` pattern, achieving 1.00x ratio.

**Architecture Verification**: Confirmed recall() implements hybrid-by-default search correctly:
- Primary: FTS5/BM25 local search (fast, <5ms)
- Fallback: Semantic search when FTS5 returns sparse results
- Tags work as filters on search results (correct SQL WHERE clause usage)

**Migration**: No schema changes. Existing caches will auto-fix on next write. Recommend clearing cache to remove FTS5 duplicates immediately: `rm -rf ~/.muninn/cache.db` then call `boot_fast()`.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **FTS5 Hybrid Search**
  - Replaced LIKE queries with FTS5 full-text search for ranked results
  - Search results now ordered by BM25 relevance instead of recency
  - Automatic semantic fallback when FTS5 returns few results
  - New `_escape_fts5_query()` helper for safe query formatting

**Performance Impact:**
- FTS5 search: ~1.2ms (faster and ranked vs unranked LIKE)
- Boot time: ~1000ms (includes FTS5 table population)
- Semantic fallback: adds ~200ms when triggered (network round-trip)

**Implementation Changes:**
```python
# New FTS5 virtual table in cache
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS memory_fts USING fts5(
    id UNINDEXED,
    summary,
    tags
);

# Cache query now uses FTS5 MATCH with BM25 ranking
SELECT i.*, bm25(memory_fts) as rank
FROM memory_fts fts
JOIN memory_index i ON fts.id = i.id
WHERE memory_fts MATCH ?
ORDER BY rank;
```

**API Changes:**
```python
# recall() now has semantic fallback options
memories = recall("search term", n=5,
                  semantic_fallback=True,      # Enable semantic fallback (default)
                  semantic_threshold=2)        # Trigger when FTS5 < 2 results

# Disable semantic fallback for pure FTS5
memories = recall("search term", semantic_fallback=False)
```

**What triggers semantic fallback:**
- FTS5 returns fewer than `semantic_threshold` results (default: 2)
- Search term was provided
- `semantic_fallback=True` (default)
- EMBEDDING_API_KEY is configured

## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-27

### Changed

- **Full Content at Boot**
  - `boot_fast()` now fetches all memory content in the initial batch query
  - Eliminated async cache warming thread (no longer needed)
  - Zero network calls after boot for any `recall()` query
  - Simplified architecture: full content cached at boot, not lazy-loaded

**Performance Impact:**
- Boot time: ~566ms (vs ~130ms in v0.7.1, acceptable tradeoff for zero mid-conversation latency)
- All recall() queries: 1-3ms (guaranteed, no network variance)
- Network calls during conversation: 0 (was unpredictable in v0.7.0-v0.7.1)

**Implementation Changes:**
```python
# boot_fast() now fetches full memories in initial batch
results = _exec_batch([
    # ... profile, ops, journal ...
    ("SELECT * FROM memories WHERE deleted_at IS NULL ORDER BY t DESC LIMIT ?", [index_n]),
])
full_memories = results[3]

# Populate both index and full content immediately
_cache_populate_index(memory_index)
_cache_populate_full(full_memories)
# No async warm_cache thread needed
```

**Cache Sync Guarantee:**
- Added explicit guidance in SKILL.md: call `flush()` before conversation end if using `sync=False`
- Ensures all background writes persist before ephemeral container destruction

## [0.7.1] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Async Cache Warming**
  - `boot_fast()` now prefetches 20 recent full memories in background thread
  - Cache warming happens during Claude's "thinking" time (non-blocking)
  - Recall performance improved to ~1ms (vs ~300ms first-access in v0.7.0)
  - Removed dead `_cache_clear()` call (unnecessary in ephemeral containers)

**Performance Impact:**
- Boot time: unchanged (~130ms)
- First recall after warming: ~1ms (299x improvement vs v0.7.0)
- Cache warming completes within ~3s in background

**Implementation:**
```python
# In boot_fast(), after populating index:
def _warm_cache():
    full_recent = _exec_batch([
        ("SELECT * FROM memories WHERE deleted_at IS NULL ORDER BY t DESC LIMIT 20", [])
    ])[0]
    _cache_populate_full(full_recent)

threading.Thread(target=_warm_cache, daemon=True).start()
```

## [0.7.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Local SQLite Cache with Progressive Disclosure**
  - New local cache in `~/.muninn/cache.db` for fast in-conversation queries
  - `boot_fast()` now populates cache with memory index (headlines only)
  - `recall()` queries local cache first (<5ms vs ~150ms network)
  - Full content lazy-loaded from Turso on first access, then cached
  - `remember()` writes to both cache and Turso (write-through)
  - `cache_stats()` for cache diagnostics

**Performance Gains:**
- First recall after boot: ~300ms (fetches full content)
- Subsequent recalls: ~2ms (149x faster via cache hit)

**API Changes:**
```python
# boot_fast() now accepts cache parameters
profile, ops, journal = boot_fast(
    journal_n=5,       # journal entries
    index_n=500,       # memory headlines to cache
    use_cache=True     # enable local cache (default)
)

# recall() uses cache automatically
memories = recall(type="decision", n=5)  # Fast if boot_fast() was called

# Bypass cache if needed
memories = recall(type="decision", use_cache=False)

# Check cache status
stats = cache_stats()
# {'enabled': True, 'available': True, 'index_count': 79, 'full_count': 6, ...}
```

**Cache Architecture:**
```
~/.muninn/
└── cache.db          # Local SQLite mirror
    ├── memory_index  # Headlines: id, type, t, tags, summary_preview
    ├── memory_full   # Full content: lazy-loaded on demand
    └── config_cache  # Full config mirror
```

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Boot Performance Optimization**
  - New `boot_fast()` function for optimized boot sequence (~130ms vs ~1100ms)
  - Batches profile + ops + journal queries in single HTTP request (8x faster)
  - Use `boot_fast()` instead of calling `profile()`, `ops()`, `journal_recent()` separately

**API**:
```python
# Fast boot (recommended)
profile, ops, journal = boot_fast()  # ~130ms, 1 HTTP request

# With decisions (if needed)
profile, ops, journal, decisions = boot()  # ~200ms, 1 HTTP request

# Slow (avoid)
profile()  # ~485ms
ops()      # ~261ms
journal_recent()  # ~222ms
# Total: ~1100ms, 3 HTTP requests
```

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed

- Fixed ambiguous column error in `semantic_recall()` vector index query by qualifying all column references
- Fixed tag deserialization: all memory queries now return `tags`, `entities`, and `refs` as parsed lists (not JSON strings)

### Added

- **Unified Write API**
  - Added `sync` parameter to `remember()` (default `True` for backwards compatibility)
  - `sync=False`: Non-blocking background write, returns immediately
  - `sync=True`: Blocking write, waits for confirmation
  - Deprecated `remember_bg()` - now an alias for `remember(..., sync=False)`
  - Added `flush()` function to wait for all pending background writes

### Added

- **Batch Query Helper**
  - New `_exec_batch()` for executing multiple SQL statements in single pipeline request
  - Reduces round-trip latency for multi-query operations
  - Automatically parses JSON fields in all result sets

**Migration**: No schema changes, fully backwards compatible.

**API Changes**:
```python
# New unified API
remember("note", "world", sync=False)  # Background write
remember("important", "decision", sync=True)  # Blocking write
flush()  # Wait for pending writes

# Old API (still works, deprecated)
remember_bg("note", "world")  # Calls remember(..., sync=False)
```

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Importance Tracking**: New `importance` parameter in `remember()` for memory prioritization (default 0.5)
- **Access Analytics**: Automatic tracking of `access_count` and `last_accessed` for all recall operations
- **Memory Classification**: `memory_class` field distinguishes episodic vs semantic memories
- **Bitemporal Tracking**: `valid_from` and `valid_to` columns for tracking when facts became/stopped being true
- **Enhanced supersede()**: Automatically sets bitemporal fields when updating memories
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) for 503/429 errors in embedding generation
- **Schema Extensions**: Six new columns added to memories table for advanced memory management

**New Parameters in remember():**
- `importance`: Float 0.0-1.0, defaults to 0.5
- `memory_class`: 'episodic' or 'semantic', defaults to 'episodic'
- `valid_from`: Timestamp when fact became true, defaults to creation time

**Migration Required**: Run `python bootstrap.py` to add new columns to existing databases
